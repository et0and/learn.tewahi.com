# Initials keychain

![Example keychain](https://media.tewahi.com/keychain.png)

For this project we are going to create our own custom keychain that will be designed and lasercut out of wood.

Your challenge is to design a keychain based on the initials of your name (first letters of your first, middle and last names).

We will learn the basics of typography, drawing for design, Adobe Illustrator, using a laser cutter, and painting to finish.
