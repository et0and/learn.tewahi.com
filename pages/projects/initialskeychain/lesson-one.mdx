For this lesson, we will:

* draw a range of rough designs

* learn about positive and negative space

* learn how to turn a simple set of initials/letters to block fonts

***

Start off with drawing upper, lower, and normal case versions of your initials on an A4 piece of paper. Your initials are the first letters of your first, middle, and last names.

Look through potential fonts on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) and [Dafont](https://dafont.com).

The letters need to be joined together. Your keychain is going to be cut out of a single piece of wood, so it is important to think about positive and negative space. Think about it like a stencil - some parts need to be solid while others are going to be cut away.

Round off any sharp edges so that your keychain won’t catch on anything inside your pocket. Try to keep all parts relatively thick so that it won’t break.

Aim for at least **10** designs in total before you choose your final!
