It's time to get our final design onto the computer so it is ready to cut!

![Using Sharedrop](https://media.tewahi.com/l31.png)

Go to [Sharedrop](https://sharedrop.io) on both your phone (which you used to take the photograph of your design), and the computer you want to send the photograph to.

Upload and send the photograph.

Next, go to [v.gd/lasercut](https://media.tewahi.com/template.ai) to download the Adobe Illustrator template you need for laser cutting and engraving. Once it has finished downloading, double click the file to open it.

Adobe Illustrator should open with a blank template file. You want to drag and drop your photograph directly onto here.

With your photograph open, click on the **Image Trace** button and select **[Default]** to convert your drawing into a clean, black and white vector image.

When your image has been traced, there will be an option to **Expand** and then **Ungroup** your design, so that you can edit out the Fill of your drawing and change the outline to a thin red stroke. Red signals to the laser cutter that you want to Cut, while Black signals that you want to Engrave. Make sure your outline is set to **0.001 px**.
