Pick your **final design**.

Redraw your final design onto a **new piece of A4 paper** using a Sharpie.

Try to keep all of your lines and edges clean.

Cut your final design out from your paper. You should end up with a design that is all **a single piece**.

Put the template against black paper background to photograph.
